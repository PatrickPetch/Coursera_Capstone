Fine Great Food @ BKK: Bangkok Food & Restaurant Data-assisted Suggestion

### Introduction

Thailand is one of the world’s most visited travelling destination, due to its fame on food, climate, and natural scenery. In 2019, Thailand attracts around 40 million of visitors, placing it amongst the top 5 countries with the most annual visitors. Bangkok, Thailand’s capital city, has a large number of tourists around 20 million each year, including 10 million of local resident living together in this city. The number of people living temporarily and permanently in Bangkok is extremely high; therefore, there is a large consumption and usage on food services and restaurants.  

### Business Problem

There are currently mainly two main problems associated with food and restaurant services industries that this project would like to address. First, due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic (as of May 2019), people all around the world are practicing safe distancing measure and be more aware of eating at restaurant, gathering with families and friends, and travelling around their own cities or other countries. With the hope that the economy would recover back to normal, there is a huge demand from both public and private sectors to encourage people not to reduce their consumption from food and beverage services, once it is safe to do so. Second, people, when they gather, often have a tough time to decide the location for eating food together. If there is a service to suggest the right restaurant at the right location that is close to the BTS [1] station, it could effectively resolve this issue and give convenience to people that gather. This will not only encourage the residents and tourist to be more convenient in using food and restaurant services, but also help the business, especially in the food and restaurant industry, to get more income and recover. Therefore, the economy can recover faster with this solution benefiting both the people and the nation.  

[1] Sky train public transportation, one of the most popular and heavily utilized transportation services in Bangkok.

### Data

The location of food and restaurant service data can be obtained from the Foursquare location data using the Foursquare API. The data about the number of check-in, together with rating and the positiveness of reviews on a particular restaurant can also be obtained from Foursquare. The data about the public transportation can be obtained from google maps location at each of the BTS station, which is done by the author of this project as the data is not readily available online.
